This repository houses the [cdnjs swag store landing page](https://swag.cdnjs.com) powered by GitHub pages and a full
archive of the customisations done to our [Spreadshirt store](https://shop.spreadshirt.net/cdnjs/) along with the plans
for all the published item designs.

Spreadshirt allow you to customise the color theme that you use for the whole store as well as providing custom CSS for
the shop and custom HTML in the header/footer. We have only made use of the custom CSS to make minor changes to the
design of the pages as overall, it works fine out of the box.
